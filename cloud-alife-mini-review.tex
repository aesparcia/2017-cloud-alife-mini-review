  \section{}
Cloud computing is the prevailing mode of designing, creating and
deploying complex applications nowadays. Its underlying assumptions
include distributed computing, but also new concepts that need to be
incorporated in the different fields. In this short paper we will make
a review of how the world of cloud computing has intersected the
complex systems and artificial life field, and how it has been used as
inspiration for new models or implementation of new and powerful
algorithms.
