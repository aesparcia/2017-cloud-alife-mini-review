  \section{}
Cloud computing is currently the prevailing mode of designing, creating and
deploying complex applications, and it has implied a paradigm shift in
all three areas; even if it taps and extends previous concepts such as
service oriented, concurrent and distributed computing, this shift has
to be eventually translated to the algorithmic and conceptual aspects
of sciences such as artificial life. In this short review we will make
a review of how the world of cloud computing has intersected the
artificial life field, and how it has been used as
inspiration for new models or implementation of new and powerful
algorithms; in the other direction, we will also examine how
artificial life concepts such as self-organization have been applied
to the field of cloud computing.

\section{Introduction}

From its start less than ten years ago, cloud computing
\citep{armbrust2010view,qian2009cloud} has become in the last two
years the dominant computing platform. Even if initially it was a
metaphor applied to virtualized resources of any kind that could be
accessed in a pay-per-use basis, it has extended itself way beyond its
initial and simple translation of data center concepts to create
completely new software architectures and methodologies for
developing, testing and deploying large scale applications. 
These new methodologies have several key issues:

\begin{itemize}

\item Infrastructure is fully automatized and described by software;
  there is no *hard* boundary between software and hardware, which are
  developed at the same time, with an application accompanied by the
  description of the resources it needs.  

\item  Applications are a loose collection of resources which interact
  asynchronously, are independent of each other, and in many cases
  have their own vendors or product owners. Some resources are
  ephemeral, appearing when they are needed and vanishing afterwards,
  some are permanent, but all of them behave reactively, acting when
  they receive information, and asynchronously, never waiting for
  response to return but relying instead on promises or other
  programming language constructs. 

\item  As such a collection, cloud-native applications become *organic*
  with parts of it changing without making the application as a whole
  a different one. There is internal evolution with continuous
  integration, testing and deployment, as well as evolution in the
  sense of a progress in fitness, as applications compete with others
  for mind and market share, as well as resources. 
\end{itemize}

All these characteristics make the cloud an environment that is closer
to artificial life than single or multidesktop applications. However,
cloud computing is relatively new and, being as it is a techno-social
system \citep{vespignani2009predicting,JJ2016} it will probably constitute
the object of study form the point of view of complex systems,
although for the time being that has not been the case, to the point
that the recent ECAL 2017 conference \citep{ecal17} only has a passing reference to
cloud systems. That is the reason why we have decided to create this
mini-review of how cloud computing has been applied in the
alife/complex systems field, with an emphasis on those papers written
in the last few years, when the cloud ecosystem has experimented a big
diversity expansion, mainly due to the introduction of containers,
isolated applications that act like lightweight virtual machines. We
will do so in the next section.

\section{First steps towards cloud as complex systems}

One of the most straightforward ways of connecting {\em old} algorithms to
*new* technologies is simply to run those algorithms using a
straightforward translation of the old technologies. Cloud computing,
for instance, offers the possibility of instantiating computing nodes
at a cost that is a fraction of buying them; thus it is just
straightforward to port an on premises parallel implementation of
whatever algorithm to a cloud-based one. That kind of transportation
hardly deserves a paper, although it does present some challenges and
has in fact been addressed in several ones; for instance \citep{Medel2017}
studies how to create models of complex systems using cloud resources
and \citep{merelo2011evostar} presents a system that uses free cloud
storage services as a device for interchanging individuals in an
evolutionary algorithm. Several other artificial life systems that use
the cloud for storage are presented in a recent review \citep{taylor2016webal}; however, there are other ways of doing this kind
of translation.

One of the possibilities that cloud computing offers
is the virtualization of computing resources and offering them {\em as a
service}. For instance, offering robot evolution as a service
\citep{du2017robot,chen2010robot} so that anyone can work with without the
need to set up their own infrastructure. Of course, these new
implementations have their own scaling and scheduling issues which can
be a challenge, but they are mostly a straightforward implementation
of $x$-as-a-framework-or-implementation to $x$-as-a-service. Besides,
as shown in the paper mentioned above, virtualizing contributes to a
reduction of costs, which is one of the first-order results of working
in the cloud, but still it is only a short step away from
service-oriented architectures.  



This cloud-based setup does have the disadvantage of needing a
permanent connection and possibly a high bandwidth. However, there is
an interesting complex-systems approach to this: so-called {\em edge
computing} \citep{satyanarayanan2017edge} moves cloud resources {\em close} to
the device or user consuming the service via technologies that allow them to access other
services using peer to peer technologies, or using mesh networks or
similar technologies to establish services that users of mainly mobile
devices can access. Since these {\em edge} nodes kind of {\em surround} the
user, they receive the denomination of {\em fog} computing too
\citep{luan2015fog}, which is studied mainly in the context of the Internet
of Things. The devices and computing nodes constituting this {\em fog}
are, effectively, a complex adaptive system \citep{yan2010application,roca2018tackling}. However, the scale and sheer
number of devices used in fog computing exceed by orders of magnitude
the one in actual cloud computing system for the time being, so that
for the time being these concepts are still not being applied to
them. It is just, however, a matter of time and scale when cloud
systems will be considered self-organizing and exhibit emergent
behavior. We will refer to this in the next section.


\section{Complex cloud systems }

Complex cloud systems would make use of the underlying physical (or
virtual) characteristics of the cloud to implement complex
systems. Most cloud systems architectures are based on queues, which
usually form the backbone of the whole system and are used to deliver
information as well as activate different modules in a way that scales
well. This feature is leveraged \citep{bottone2016implementing}, which
implements an ant-based system using the MQTT queue management
framework to deposit virtual pheromones, which are then {\em sniffed} by
agents in an stigmergic algorithm. Instead of simply implementing an
array in one of the virtual nodes or a database which can be read from
any client, this is a way that translates bioinspired algorithms to
their closest equivalent in a virtual environment, creating cloud
native complex adaptive systems. 

This can be taken further; every module in a cloud system is not
adaptive, performing whatever service it has been programmed to do via
its description. But lately, some cloud systems are being built with
self-* principles in mind; as services in the cloud acquire autonomy
in what is called {\em autonomic computing}, {\em adaptation} is not far away
and services become adaptive, being able to self-organize and the
whole system to self-heal, two agencies that make a cloud system
acquire complex adaptive behaviour, such as being able to reconfigure
connections, spawn new copies or eliminate them, all in an autonomic
way without needing to rely on a central authority, using peer to peer
protocols such as the {\em gossip} protocol \citep{LNCS44480129}, which has
actually been used for evolutionary algorithms \citep{laredo09cache} before
cloud computing was even created.

\section{Conclusions}

As can be observed by the dearth of references for complex cloud
systems or cloud-native artificial life, we are still in the early
stages of its development, with the cloud being used mainly as a
resource for the straightforward porting of earlier systems. Some
steps have been taking in the realization of the complex adaptive
nature of systems and in the application of complex systems methods
such as stigmergy or gossip protocols to cloud native applications,
but it is still an early stage of development. The next few months or
years will undoubtedly bring new and unexpected developments to this
field that will provide benefits in both directions: insights in the
study of cloud as socio-technical systems and new ways of implementing
cloud-native artificial life forms.
